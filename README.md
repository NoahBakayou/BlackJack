# Blackjack Game in Java

## Overview
This project is a text-based Blackjack game implemented in Java. It demonstrates clean, organized, and efficient coding practices with a focus on object-oriented programming principles.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can experience the classic Blackjack game against an automated dealer.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: The codebase is divided into three main classes (`Main`, `Deck`, and `Game`), emphasizing modularity and readability.
- **Dynamic Deck Handling**: Features an automated deck shuffling using the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm for randomness.

## Technical Highlights
- **Deck Class**: Manages deck creation and shuffling, ensuring a fresh deck in each game round.
- **Game Class**: Handles the core game logic, including player and dealer actions, as well as game rules.
- **Error Handling**: Robust checks for invalid inputs and deck exhaustion are implemented.
- **Scalable Architecture**: The design facilitates easy expansion and adaptation for different card games or additional features.

## How to Run
To play the game, clone the repository and run the `Main` class. Java must be installed on your machine.

```bash
git clone <URL_TO_REPOSITORY>
cd <REPOSITORY_NAME>
java Main.java
```
